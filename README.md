### What I learned

I was looking for a way to match div width to content and found the following rule. I'm not sure how well-supported it is.

```css
.category {
    width: fit-content;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to become more familiar with media queries and common practices when using them, also, develop a sass workflow that generates them easily.
